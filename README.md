## and, or, and nor

Verbs agree with the closest subject;

- Neither the men nor the woman (SINGULAR) is a robot.
- Neither the woman nor the men (PLURAL) are robots.

An initial negative propagates to all enumerated elements;

- I do not like hot dogs, ketchup, or mustard.
- I will not eat chocolate cake for breakfast or even consider eating cheesecake for breakfast.

"Neither" and "nor" must form parallelism, where "nor" prefixes each parallel block;

- I like neither hot dogs (NOUN) nor ketchup (NOUN) nor mustard (NOUN).
- (I do not like to sleep (VERB) early.) Nor do I like to wake up (VERB) at 5 AM.
- I will not eat (VERB) chocolate cake for breakfast nor even consider (VERB) eating cheesecake for breakfast.
